Beyond the quiet crackling of distant fires, it is eerily quiet. The silence is only broken by the occasional flash of lightning, followed by roaring thunderclaps. It's been hours since that Abe guy messed everything up and yet the *storm* rages on. Only without any rain to extinguish the flames.
A solitary *blimp* sits on the runway.
You feel a strange sense of finality being here. If you leave now, there will never be another opportunity to deal with any unfinished business here.

It takes the blimp's engine a few attempts to finally kick in, but after a while you slowly feel the machine lift away from the roof and ascend into the sky. As you glance back, you realize you couldn't have taken off at a better moment. The second your craft cleared the runway, the roof began to collapse into itself, the sinkhole promptly swallowing a metric ton of concrete, before vomiting back a mixture of dust and black smoke.
You gulp a little and decide to look away instead. To steel your resolve, you think about all the ways you and the boss will 'pay' back all the misery that Abe guy had caused you. You chuckle a little. Next time it won't be anything as simple as a meatsaw. Yet, as much as you're trying to distract yourself with morbidity, you can still hardly believe you've managed to survive.
${o?"You glance up at the cap sitting proudly on your head and take a deep breath, allowing much of the stress to evaporate from your body. For the first time in a long time, you feel a bit optimistic all of the sudden. You're not even sure why, but you feel like things are gonna get better.":"You can't entirely calm yourself. You frown a little. Something seems to be missing. You'll be fine, but you feel a bit of hollowness. Perhaps you've left something back you weren't supposed to?"}
With your course set, you lean back and close your eyes. It's been an awful day. As the ruins of your former home slowly disappear behind the horizon, you hear the boss groan and sputter. His single remaining eye pierces your soul as he demands to know what happened. You stand up and ask him to stay sitting. That way it'll be easier to take the news. You've survived RuptureFarms... surely you'll survive him too.

Even before having a second to open your eyes, stimuli already began bombarding your mind. You feel your body press against something deathly cold. Your head is screaming at you with an ache worse than during your wildest hangovers. Something next to you screeches incessantly, like a thousand nails scraping on metal. And, last but not least, your entire being is in pain, like you were just beaten to an inch of your life.
You groan and blindly grope around, trying to find something to grab in an attempt to stabilize your spinning head. Slowly the nausea retracts just enough for you to attempt standing up, but despite several valiant attempts, you keep tumbling back like a helpless, overturned bug. The diagnosis is clear: Your legs have seized. Unfortunate and embarrassing, but it happens sometimes.
You reach down half-blind and fumble with the harness until you find the small reset button.
The machine spends a few seconds just whirring helplessly while belching poisonous fumes. You hack and wheeze as you wait, the noxious gas not helping your head in the slightest. You're just about to whack it in frustration when, without warning, it suddenly jerks back to life, allowing you to unceremoniously scramble onto your legs once more.
Having finally escaped from the floor, you feel yourself well enough to figure out what's going on. You have some vague memories about what happened, but still, it'd probably be the best to first *look around*. Unless, of course, you'd rather just call out to your momma for *help*.`)});
